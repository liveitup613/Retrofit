# Retrofit-Android-Example

A simple example of using Retrofit in MVP pattern with custom error handling.


NOTE:-

1. This is a simple demo app of using Retrofit Network Layer in MVP pattern and Custom Error Handling.
2. I have not focused on UI part. Have only taken a single Activity class and all the button over there.
3. All button click is only to show, how to init the API call and handle the response coming from the server end.
4. I have not added URL, please add your own URLs, keys and endpoints in "ApiConstants.class" file
   and make the API calls as per your needs.
5. Rest of the things will work fine once you will follow the above points.
6. Happy coding...!!
